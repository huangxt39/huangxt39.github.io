I'm a PhD student at Saarland University, advised by [Michael Hahn](https://www.mhahn.info). I'm part of [Language, Computation, and Cognition Lab (LaCoCo)](https://lacoco-lab.github.io/home/). I obtained my Master's degree in IT and Cognition at University of Copenhagen, and Bachelor's degree in Intelligence Science and Technology at Sun Yat-sen University.

I’m broadly interested in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My current research interest lies in interpretability of neural language models. Since the start of my PhD study, I've been working in this field, aiming to unravel the mysteries of neural networks and understand their inner-workings.
